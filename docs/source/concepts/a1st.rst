App-First AI
============

In the application of ML in industry, one often faces the question, “I have a bunch of data. Can we build a useful model with it?” While useful for strategic brainstorming, this is now practiced to an unhealthy degree. We have observed this phenomenon and call it the “model-first” mentality. Therefore, the better approach is needed to provide the anchor, framework, and modern tooling around the realization that fundamentally, we still need to start with an “application-first” (or “system-first”) mentality. 

App-First AI aimed at:
  - creating a powerful yet easy-to-use framework for building and running AI applications.
  - providing end-to-end workflow, from development to deployment to execution and feedback.
  - ensuring ensure that the development process starts with human needs, business requirements, use-case and user-experience design, followed by modeling and construction.
  - choosing and applying engineering best practices in building applications.
