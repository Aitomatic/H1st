MLModeler and MLModel
#####################

In `h1st`, we explicitly split the machine learning activities into two sets and assign them to `MLModeler` and `MLModel`. `MLModeler` is responsible for data loading, data exploration, data preparation and model training/building while `MLModel` generates predictions, persists and loads model parameters.

Let's take a look at a simple example. We want to build `MLModel`s that is backed by `sklearn`'s `RandomForestClassifier`. The framework handles most of the work for you and you just need to do two things:
  - Write a custom `MLModel` and implement the `predict` method which invokes its `sklearn` base_model's `predict` method.
  - Write a custom `MLModeler` and implement the `train_base_model` method to train an `sklearn`'s `RandomForestClassifier`.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Custom MLModeler and MLModel

    import os
    import tempfile
    from typing import Any, Dict
    from h1st.model.ml_model import MLModel
    from h1st.model.ml_modeler import MLModeler
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    class MyMLModel(MLModel):
        def predict(self, input_data: Dict) -> Dict:
            return {'predictions': self.base_model.predict(input_data['X'])}

    class MyMLModeler(MLModeler):
        def __init__(self):
            self.model_class = MyMLModel

        def train_base_model(self, prepared_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
            X, y = prepared_data['X'], prepared_data['y']
            model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
            model.fit(X, y)
            return model

By calling `MLModeler`'s `build_model` method, you get an instance of `MLModel` and are able to get prediction on new data and evaluate the model's accuracy.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Model training and prediction

    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
    prepared_data = {'X': X_train, 'y': y_train}
    my_modeler = MyMLModeler()
    my_model = my_modeler.build_model(prepared_data)

    y_pred = my_model.predict({'X': X_test})['predictions']
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Accuracy (test): %0.1f%% " % (accuracy * 100))

When you are satisfied with the model, you can persist its parameters for later usage such as model serving.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Model persistence and loading

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as path:
        # Set the model repository to the temporary directory
        os.environ['H1ST_MODEL_REPO_PATH'] = path
        my_model.persist('1st_version')

        # Load the model from the repo
        my_model_2 = MyMLModel()
        my_model_2.load_params('1st_version')
        y_pred = my_model_2.predict({'X': X_test})['predictions']
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
        print("Accuracy (test): %0.1f%% " % (accuracy * 100))

Pretty simple, isn't it. Enjoy building your machine learning models!!!
